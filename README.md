# NBA-Power-Partnership-Analysis
In this project, we want to learn why are certain basketball teams are successful. The 19-20 Lakers champion team was used as an example.

## Introduction
The 2019-20 NBA season was a defining year for the Los Angeles Lakers, marked by the dynamic duo of LeBron James (LBJ) and Anthony Davis (AD). In their first season together, they led the Lakers to an NBA championship, showcasing their dominance. With combined averages of 51.4 points per game (LBJ: 25.3 ppg, AD: 26.1 ppg) and outscoring opponents by 11.05 points per 100 possessions when on the court together, they exemplified one of the league's most formidable 'power partnerships.' This project uses the 19-20 Lakers as a case study to explore two primary questions:

1. How does a team best utilize a 'power partnership'?
2. Do great players enhance the performance of their teammates?
 
## How does a team best utilize a 'power partnership'?
1. Strategic On-Court Pairing:

LBJ and AD frequently play together during key game periods, specifically in the first half of the 1st and 3rd quarters, as well as the final five minutes of the game.
They alternate leading the team, ensuring at least one is almost always on the court.
This rotation strategy maintains a stable and positive point difference throughout the game.

2. Effective Team Management:

The Lakers implemented a consistent pattern for player rotation and load management.
Star players were given appropriate rest without sacrificing team performance.
The deep bench, featuring experienced players like Rajon Rondo, Alex Caruso, and Dwight Howard, according to NBA.com, ranked 2nd in net rating among all teams, providing substantial support when the stars were resting.

## Do great players enhance the performance of their teammates?
To assess how LeBron James and Anthony Davis impacted their teammates, we analyzed the team's performance using five metrics. The data revealed that while individual performances of LBJ and AD were strong (e.g., the highest Teammate FG% of 48.28% when only LeBron was on the court), the team's overall performance peaked when both stars played together. This combination yielded the highest Net Rating (outscoring opponents by 11.05 points per 100 possessions) and Plus/Minus (10.44).

## Conclusion - The Secret Recipe
The success of the 19-20 Lakers can be attributed to several key factors:

On-Court Strategy: Consistent and strategic pairing of LBJ and AD during crucial game periods.\
Load Management: Balanced scheduling of playing and rest times to maintain player performance and health.\
Deep Bench: A strong bench that could sustain competitiveness when star players were off the court.\
